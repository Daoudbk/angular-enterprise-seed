    <h3>An AngularJS seed for serious web apps...</h3><hr>

    <p>
        This project is meant to serve as a more substantial starting point for enterprise and commercial web applications.  It integrates AngularJS with projects like Angular-UI, Angular-Strap, Bootstrap, and jQuery, along with examples of angular services, directives, controllers, and filters.
    </p>


    <p>
    <b>Goals include:</b>
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remain static, as in no web server _processing_ required.  The only need for a web server is to host the contents of the app folder.</li>
        <li>Integrate best-of-breed JavaScript MVC, styling, ui, and tooling components "the Angular way"</li>
        <li>Provide examples of services, directives, controllers, and filters in a way that can be cherry picked for use elsewhere.</li>
        <li>See Authentication and REST service examples and fadein and stop-propagation directive examples.</li>
        <li>Provide example of ui widgets done the Angular way.  See the Playground menu option in the top navbar.  UI/widget examples include a paginated grid with sort and filter support, accordion, tree, tabs, and date/time pickers.</li>
    </ul>
