                    <strong>Art Cards For Causes</strong>
                    was founded by the Jewett family in 2010. It is a labor of love and commitment, and one that will
                    continue to grow, change and develop, as the world will demand. Our view of art is that it is as
                    critical as food and water. Our decision to donate 20% of our proceeds to Non-profits around the
                    world, reflects our admiration, and appreciation, to all those people who labor out of their love
                    and commitment for the betterment of our earth, and for all those who depend upon it. The concept
                    for Art Cards for Causes LLC was inspired by a world in need, its people, its environment, its
                    plants and animals, its economy. There is a constant plea for help, on every continent; daily
                    survival, loss of culture, crisis of humanity and environmental disasters, economic depression. Our
                    own feeling of â€œhow can one, or three, or even 30,000 people make any difference? One drop in the
                    bucket, one person, one step at a time, together we can, and will, make a difference. Support for
                    the arts and artists is dwindling. Art programs in schools are a luxury. Art Galleries are becoming
                    more and more limited and selective, therefore artists have an even more difficult time thriving as
                    artists. We do not believe art is optional; it is integral to being human, and connected to our
                    past, present and our future. Art has the ability to transcend a given moment, and give pleasure to
                    people of all walks of life. It is art that is often the only thing kept by generations for future
                    generations, it can tell a personal story, a family history, historical events, cultural beliefs, or
                    document a point in time. Art can restore the human spirit and give life again to something or
                    someone lost, or in need of inspiration.

                    Tilly is... not a dog really, she is more of a cartoon, and a genius at comic relief. She reminds us
                    at numerous moments throughout our day that it is important to take at least 5 minutes to stop and
                    play... with her of course.

                parents, and family, all talented and accomplished artists are her greatest inspiration. Wendy would

                multifaceted from furniture design and construction, glass casting / etching, stone / steel sculpture,
                lighting design / fabrication, graphic design, drawing and painting. Wendy has, and continues, to
                participate on nonprofit boards, for the arts, environment, and her local community.
